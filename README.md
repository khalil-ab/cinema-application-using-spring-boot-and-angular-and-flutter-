Here are the instructions of his app :

- Each cinema located in a city is defined by its code, name and geographical position. 
- The cinema contains a set of theaters.
- Each cinema is defined by its number, its name contains a set of seats.
- Each seat has a number and is geographically positioned.
- Every day, several film screenings are scheduled in theaters.
- Each Projection takes place in a screening, concerns one Film and takes place in a Room on a date of 
- projection and a fixed price.
